A stream is a collection of objects (just as JSON objects) which will be loaded onto memory only on demand.
This means that our data loader is loading data “lazily”, i.e, only when needed.

This relaxes the memory requirement when working with large files. The content of the stream is stored in a temporary buffer,
which makes it possible to deal with gigabytes of JSON files!
